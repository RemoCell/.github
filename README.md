# Future goal

This software isn't developed yet. Goal: Share & download cellular/mobile signal (strength) data and
show it offline on top of a (mainstream) offline map.

# For now

## On Android, for now use

- Google Maps with offline maps
  - NOT "Google Maps Go"
  - to download offline maps: Top right > Your profile icon > Offline maps.
- and
  - [NetMonitor Cell Signal Logging = Net Monitor Lite
    app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.v_a_v.netmonitor). That allows you to
    record the signal strength of your career and see it on top of Google Maps. The find the
    recordings in the "Sessions" tab.
  - [Coverage?](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.twostepsbeyond.coverage) by [Two
    Steps Beyond](https://twostepsbeyond.com/apps/coverage/) to get US (and supposedly Canadian)
    cell grid. But the data is as reported by the carriers - which [may differ to
    reality](https://twostepsbeyond.com/apps/app-support-faqs/)!

Don't waste your time on other Android apps - as of November 2024 any other signal/tower/coverage
apps need data connection.

## On iPhone/iPad

- no apps to record signal strength, because iOS doesn't give as much access/API, unfortunately.
- use [Coverage? Lite](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/coverage-lite/id418908913) or
  [Coverage?](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/coverage/id388815949), as described by [Two Steps
  Beyond](https://twostepsbeyond.com/apps/coverage/).
